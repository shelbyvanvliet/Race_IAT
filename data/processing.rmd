Positive D1 scores refer to faster responding on the block where response mappings are shared between trial types 1 & 3 and 2 & 4 (e.g., flowers-positive/insects-negative) than the block where response mappings are shared between trial types 1 & 4 and 2 & 3 (e.g., flowers-negative/insects-positive).
